## Class Logistics

- Class is from 9am to 5pm Eastern Time
- Class session are March 18-10
- There is a one-hour lunch from 12 to 1
- This hour is sacrosanct, this gives you time to schedule non-class activities like phone meetings etc
- There will be a 15-minute break roughly mid-morning and another roughly mid-afternoon

#### Materials

- All materials are in this repository and are available until April 28, 2024 at this link  [Materials Repository](https://github.com/ExgnosisClasses/RFT-March18.git)
- All materials are published under a creative commons or equivalent license that permits free sharing.

#### Lab Environments

- You will be assigned virtual machines to use on the first day of class.

---

#### Pre and Post Tests

- You are required to do a multiple choice pre and post test
- This is **not** designed to test _you:_ it is anonymous and servers as an aggregate measure of how effective the class was.

- For the pre test
    - Do not guess. If you don't know the answer, select the "don't know" option
    - Do not look answers online or elsewhere, this will skew the results

- For the post test
    - You may use any materials you have acquired during class
    - But you still can't look up answers online or ask someone else.
